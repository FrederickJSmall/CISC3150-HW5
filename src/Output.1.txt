According to the Java Docs we know that a protected member in a package can be accessed by members of the same class, sibling classes or it's sub-classes. 
What is not readily known is; if you attempt to access a protected member from a class that is within another package java will mark the 
member of the first package as private. This happens as soon as you attempt to create a new instance of the class from the second package.  
  
Based on the links and some analysis it has been determined that a Protected member can only be accessed by other members or sub-classes. 
With the one exception noted earlier. When the member is being accessed from a member of another package; even when it's a subclass; that member will be rendered 
as private once the new class has been instanced.
